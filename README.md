Here’s a sample **README.md** for your "India States Game" Turtle project:

---

# 🧩 India States & UTs Game 🗺️

A fun and educational Python game that helps you learn and locate all the **States and Union Territories** of India using the `turtle` graphics module.

---

## 🎮 How It Works

* A political map of India is displayed using the Turtle module.
* You type the names of Indian **States** or **Union Territories**.
* If correct, the name appears on the map at its corresponding location.
* You can exit the game anytime by typing `"Exit"` or pressing Cancel.
* Missed states/UTs are saved to a `states_you_missed.csv` file for learning later!

```
📦 India States Game
├── India States-UTs.csv          # Contains state/UT names with (x, y) coordinates for plotting
├── political-map.gif             # The India map used as game background
├── india_states_game.py         # Main game script

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Ensure `India States-UTs.csv` and `political-map.gif` are in the same directory as the Python script.
3. Run the game:

```bash
python india_states_game.py
```

## 📌 CSV Format

The `India States-UTs.csv` should be structured like this:

| State/UT    | x   | y    |
| ----------- | --- | ---- |
| Maharashtra | 50  | -20  |
| Tamil Nadu  | 120 | -140 |
| ...         | ... | ...  |

* `State/UT`: Name of the state or UT.
* `x`, `y`: Coordinates for label placement on the map.
